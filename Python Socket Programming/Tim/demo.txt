Note the statistics at the end of the output. 
This can be helpful when you’re trying to discover 
intermittent connectivity problems. For example, is 
there any packet loss? How much latency is there? You 
can check the round-trip times.If there’s a firewall between 
you and the other host, a ping’s echo request may not be allowed. 
Some firewall administrators implement policies that enforce this.
 The idea is that they don’t want their hosts to be discoverable. 
 If this is the case and you have firewall rules added to allow the 
 hosts to communicate, then make sure that the rules also allow ICMP to pass between them.ICMP is the protocol used by ping, 
 but it’s also the protocol TCP and other lower-level protocols use to communicate error messages. If you’re experiencing strange 
 behavior or slow connections, this could be the reason. ICMP messages are identified by type and code. 
 To give you an idea of the important information they carry, here are a few. In the section Viewing 
 Socket State, you learned how netstat can be used to display information about sockets and their 
 current state. This utility is available on macOS, Linux, and Windows. That section didn’t mention 
 the columns Recv-Q and Send-Q in the example output. These columns will show you the number of bytes that 
 are held in network buffers that are queued for transmission or receipt, but for some reason haven’t been 
 read or written by the remote or local application. In other words, the bytes are waiting in network buffers 
 in the operating system’s queues. One reason could be that the application is CPU bound or is otherwise unable
