>> The modular programming approach where the code is broken down into 
separate parts is where python modules comes into picture. 

>> Modules are simply a ‘program logic’ or a ‘python script’ that can be 
used for variety of applications or functions. We can declare functions, 
classes etc in a module.

>> Creating a module in python is similar to writing a simple python script 
using the .py extension. For the above example lets try to make a module for 
the various operations.

>> When we import a module, the interpreter looks for the module in the build-in 
modules directories in sys.path and if not found, it will look for the module in 
the following order:

- Current directory
- PYTHONPATH
- Default directory

>> To get the list of all the modules in python, you can write the following 
command in the python console.

help('modules')

>> It returns a sorted list of strings containing the names defined in a module. 
The list contains the names of all the variables, functions, classes etc. 

import calc
 
print(dir(calc))
