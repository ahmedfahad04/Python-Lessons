## Complex Number
u = a + bi
v = c + di

* u + v = (a+c)+(b+d)i
* u - v = (a-c)+(b-d)i
* uv = (ac-bd)+(bc+ad)i
* u/v = (ac + bd)/(c2 + d2) + (bc â€“ ad) /(c2 + d2) i
1. u.real = a; u.imag = b;`[they are just numbers]`
2. while using complex number you must use
**cmath** not ~~math~~
3. _cmath_ always return **complex** number.

## Important Topics
1. Find root of eqn. Always remember to write 
the eqn as follows in the question. Each **braces** and
even the serial of the **operand** should the maintained.
