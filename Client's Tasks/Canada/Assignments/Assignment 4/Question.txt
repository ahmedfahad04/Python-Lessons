a) In the 1st Question of Assignment 4 a funciton named 
"def buildPossibleAnswers(Coeff,Xmin, Xmax, Ymin, Ymax, Zmin, Zmax)".
Accoding to the description I need to show a prompt to the user. But what is in that prompt? What should ask to user to enter?
It is not mentioned in the question.

And
b) It is also said that after valid input return the combination of
answers in a list. But I return the combination of x,y,z then what the use of calling 'Coeff' in that function. Do I need to calculate the right side value of eqn using this 'Coeff' and put it in the list? If not then what is the use of 'Coeff' in that function?

c) In the first sample output of Question 1 we see that the value of x,y,z are not from [-9,9]. Rather it's range is [1,3],[-2,2],[-5,6] respectively for x,y,z. So I am confused about the parameter of Xmin, Xmax, Ymin, Ymax, Zmin, Zmax value? how to define the vlaue of these parameter? 

d) Regarding the Question 2 of that assignment. I have enter value of "A1,F1,A2,F2,time,numel". Now question is will the user will input these value or the marker will manually enter the value? Do I need to add any prompt for each of these inputs?
