# Purpose:    The purpose of the question to write a python program(script)
#             to calculating the approximate circumference of an ellipse.

"""

a) How long did it take for your solution to question 1 to compute the
circumference of the ellipse?

>> 12.027 seconds.

b) How long did it take for your solution to question 2 to compute the
circumference of the ellipse?

>> 41.063 seconds.

c) How long did it take for your solution to question 3 to compute the
circumference of the ellipse?

>> 1.985 seconds.

d) Which program ran the slowest?

>> Program 2

e) Which program ran the fastest?

>> Program 3

f) What do you conclude from this? Do not simply state what you observed.
State when it is appropriate to use lists and when it is appropriate to use
arrays in the solution of a problem.

>> It can be concluded that Vector Arithmetic is the fastest way among these 
methods to solve a problem.

On the other hand if the elements are fixed and no need to add or remove 
elements it is good to use Array. It will consume less memory and time to 
solve mathematical problems.

But we can also reduce the time and space complexity more flexibly by removing 
the loops from the scripts. And here comes the turn of Vector. We implement 
vector using array. Using vector we can compute mathematical problem in very 
short time comparing with array and list. 

Summing up that it is better to use array/vector when the elements are fixed 
and nothing need to be add or remove to the data set. Otherwise we can go with 
list to solve our problems.
