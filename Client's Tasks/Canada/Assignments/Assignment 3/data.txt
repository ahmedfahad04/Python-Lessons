The inherited prejudices about time and space did
not allow any doubt to arise as to the prime importance of the
Galileian transformation for changing over from one body of reference
to another. If a general law of nature were to be found which did not
satisfy this condition, then at least one of the two fundamental
assumptions of the theory would have been disproved. In this connection we did not obtain the Galilei
transformation, but, differing from classical mechanics, the Lorentz
transformation. If
an observer sitting in the position M1 in the train did not possess
this velocity, then he would remain permanently at M. it did not
appear impossible that the answer to this question might be in the
negative.
